V-FAST is an open-source computational platform designed to support the implementation of performance-based earthquake engineering (PBEE). V-FAST enables the estimation of fragility functions for individual buildings and representative taxonomies, and the calculation of vulnerability functions using a story-based methodology. This story-based loss estimation (SBLE) approach leverages structural response data and component-level damage models to compute expected losses at the component, story, and building levels. The platform integrates key components of the PEER-PBEE framework into a streamlined workflow that enhances interpretability and facilitates its application across research, academic, and professional settings. V-FAST features a graphical interface that provides full visualization of inputs, intermediate computations, and final outputs, thereby improving usability and transparency.
