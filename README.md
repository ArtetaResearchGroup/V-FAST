**V-FAST** is an **open-source computational platform** designed to support the implementation of **performance-based earthquake engineering (PBEE)**. 🚀

It enables the estimation of **fragility functions** for individual buildings and representative taxonomies, as well as the calculation of **vulnerability functions** using a **story-based methodology**. This **story-based loss estimation (SBLE)** approach leverages **structural response data** and **component-level damage models** to compute expected losses at the component, story, and building levels. 🏢📊

The platform integrates key components of the **PEER-PBEE** framework into a streamlined workflow that enhances interpretability and facilitates its application across **research**, **academic**, and **professional settings**.

**V-FAST** features a **graphical interface** that provides full visualization of inputs, intermediate computations, and final outputs, thereby improving usability and transparency. 👀🔍
